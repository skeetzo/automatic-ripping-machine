right now ARM uses a bunch of APIs to search for track info

i want to enter the basic title / artist on the music cd and i want it to find whatever that is

so this only affects music cds

so i want to launch firefox, search wiki, and verify top down links for the correct phrase

so i want to prompt if i'm searching for an:
: album -> search w/ "album" 
: film -> search w/ "original motion picture soundtrack"

urlString = title + modifier

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=$urlString

if the page doesn't have a 'Track Listing' section, then its useless

then i can verify the page
: album -> "is the __nth [words] album"
: film -> "is the __nth [words] film"

so grab the Track Listing and create a metadata.txt file
- abcde rips the music to files
- ffmpeg to add the metadata from the metadata.txt file

so i need to add selenium and ffmpeg-*9999999999999999/88888888888888









a cd is found as either a film or an album on wikipedia

- album:
: "is the third studio album"
: "is the sixth studio album"
: "is the first in the A Very Special Christmas series of Christmas-themed compilation albums"
- film:
: "is a 2007 American live action/computer animated musical comedy film"


search google / wikipedia

google: $albumname + "album"
- first link should be wiki link
- but just get first occurring wiki link
wikipedia: $albumname + "(album)" or $albumname
- if wiki search results, get first link
- do search again without "(album)", compare result with 1st result in search for redundancy

once wiki page has been located,
## - find the main artist if exists in the link
## CONFIRM the artist
- verify it has a Track Listings section
## - find the main artist if exists anywhere on page
## CONFIRM the artist
from the track listing section, scrape:
- the versions
from each version, scrape
- No. / #, Title / Song Title, Writer(s), Version covered, Artist, Producer(s), Length / Time

match the version by comparing the number of tracks on the cd to the number of tracks in each version
CONFIRM success
update the metadata

if no versions match the number of tracks on the cd, then the wikipedia page is wrong
repeat process for 2nd wiki link from google results, and so on


or if motion picture soundtrack search: $albumname + "film"
same process for wiki page for film w/ a Track Listings section

###
if the album was listed as having multiple sides it'll be off
each side needs to be added cumulatively to manage the correct track number

- US track listing
  Side one
  ...
  Side two
  ...

###



these results are useful if no results show up for a motion picture soundtrack:
-----------------------------
allmusic:
Sample 		Title/Composer 	Performer 	Time 	Stream

discogs:
 Tracklist                  
1 	â€“Starship (2) 	Wild Again
					  Written-By â€“ John Bettis, Michael Clark (3)		4:43




spotify api sorta works as a method of finding motion picture soundtracks and their image

search for: $album + "(Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)"
ignore any results that don't match like "(Original Score from the Motion Picture)"

search -> album id -> album -> track info
- follow playlist
- get album -> get album tracks
- get image from album
get album: artist, track name, track number, duration_ms
search, get track: release_date
